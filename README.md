### How hard is it to make games in Haskell ?

Pretty hard to figure out a good setup; relatively easy and pleasant after that,
for non-resource-intensive games at least.
These notes and examples aim to help.

### Some problems and solutions

(as of 2021-09)

#### Packaging/installation

**Minimising packaging boilerplate and complex/unreliable install instructions**\
Use a [stack script with `script` command](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter).

**Getting stack script header just right**

- Specify all extra packages (packages other than `base` that you import from)
  with `--package` options in the stack script header.
  If you forget any, the script may run for you but fail for others.

- If they depend on packages not in stackage, you must also mention each of those
  (the error message will list them.)

- Use a block comment (`{- -}`) so that you can write packages and options on multiple lines.
  (A line comment (`--`) will work only for one line.)

**Avoiding apparent hang when ghc is installed on first run**\
Add `--verbosity=info` to stack options line to show ghc install progress
(but this also shows unwanted "resolver" output on every run.
`--verbosity=warning` hides that, but still shows package install progress.
`--verbosity=error` hides that too.)

**Avoiding recompilation delay on every run**\
Use `script --compile` in stack options line
(or `script --optimize`, which might take longer and/or run faster).

**Running stack script in threaded mode when using packages that require this**\
(ansi-terminal-game, etc.):  add `--ghc-options=-threaded` to stack options line

**Providing ready-to-run binaries that don't require the user to have `stack` or other haskell tools**

- set up Github CI workflows to build binary artifacts on the main platforms 
  (and ideally, statically link the GNU/Linux binary);
  add those to a Github release for stable download url.

- mac: get your app packaged in homebrew

- etc.

**Providing screenshots/screencasts**\
use a convenient screenshot tool on your platform (eg CMD-SHIFT-5 and friends on mac);
or install and use asciinema to record .cast files,
asciicast2gif or similar to convert those to animated GIF images;
add the images to a README.md.

#### Tools

**Getting haskell-language-server to see extra packages, eg for editing in VS Code**\
add this `hie.yaml` in the same directory:
```
cradle:
  stack:
```
and `stack install` each extra package in stack's global project.\
(Still flaky..)

**Configure GHC build options, eg to silence unwanted warnings**\
Add lines above your imports like\
`{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wno-missing-signatures -Wno-unused-imports #-}`

**Enabling/disabling GHC's optional Haskell language extensions**\
Add lines above your imports like\
`{-# LANGUAGE MultiWayIf, RecordWildCards #-}`

#### Terminal/console games

**Drawing anywhere on the terminal, portably**\
use [ansi-terminal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal)

**Getting non-blocking input, a ready-made event loop, and more powerful drawing, portably**\
use [ansi-terminal-game](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal-game)

**Getting more powerful input/drawing/event loop, if you don't care about Windows**\
use [vty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty) and [brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick)

**Getting arrow key and modifier key inputs**\
use vty
